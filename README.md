# Playing with Jupyter Lab & Notebooks - Maths meanderings

2021 - My daughters are in primary, KS2, Y6, using Jupyter Lab ito design Maths
exercises for them may be slightly overkill :-) but it is fun.

On the other hand my nephew is doing A-level Maths, and I find it quite handy
occasionallly to write formal Maths with this fantastic tool.
